# Roadmap
A list of features and distros YuZu will have in the near future but doesn't have currently.

 - [x ] Plasma 6 switch (Plasma 5 will still be available from the legacy build).
 - [ ] Config script (Make customization of the window manager easier with a shell based GUI).
 - [ ] Yterm (Replace Konsole with a better more simple terminal emulator designed just for YuZu).
 - [ ] Create a way to install from the default package manager.
 I will add more here soon.
